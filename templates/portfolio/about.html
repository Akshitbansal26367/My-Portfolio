            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h4>Django Developer with an Interest in Machine Learning</h4>

            <p>
                I am a backend-focused developer who enjoys building clean,
                scalable, and user-friendly web applications. My primary
                expertise lies in Django, where I focus on writing maintainable
                code and building reliable backend systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alongside web development, I have a strong interest in data
                science and machine learning. I am familiar with supervised
                learning techniques such as linear regression and decision
                trees, and I enjoy exploring how data-driven models can be
                integrated into real-world applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am continuously learning new technologies, improving my
                problem-solving skills, and building projects that create
                meaningful impact and enhance user experience.
